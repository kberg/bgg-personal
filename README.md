# bgg-personal
This Chrome Extension adds a link exposing the "Flag this thread for personal reasons" functionality on BoardGameGeek. Excellent for managing large and ever-changing geeklists where you don't want to be reminded of elements you've already viewed and evaluated, like auctions or local marketplaces.

Normally to hide an item from a Geeklist you must:

1. Click the small red X
2. Click "Personal" in the new popup.

This extension basically turns that into a single step. It also makes the clickable range much larger by being a full word.
